# Mini Roadmap Visualiser

A tiny, **static** roadmap you can host on GitHub Pages. Shows items grouped by **quarter** with **RICE** scores.

**Great for:** prioritisation frameworks, stakeholder comms, lightweight PM visuals.

## Run locally
Just open `public/index.html` in your browser.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Push repo to GitHub.
2. Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` → `/` root.
3. Paste the Pages URL here in the README.

## What to edit
- `public/data.json` → your roadmap items
- `public/index.html` → titles/branding

## Next ideas
- Filters by team/owner
- Export to CSV
- Sort by Impact or Effort
